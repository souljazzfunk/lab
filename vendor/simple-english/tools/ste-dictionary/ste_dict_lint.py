"""Count words that are not approved in ASD-STE100, in a text.

`ste_lint.py` measures the mechanical writing rules. It does not look at word
choice. This tool covers the other half: it reads `not-approved.tsv` and reports
each word in the text that the standard does not approve, with the approved
alternatives.

It also reads `slop.tsv` and reports LLM-tell words as a separate count. These
are the high-consensus terms (8 or more independent published ban lists) that
the STE dictionary does not rule on. The two counts do not overlap: a word in
both lexicons counts as a dictionary hit only.

Known ceiling: the match is on the base form and on simple inflections
(-s, -es, -ed, -ing, -ly). It does not do part-of-speech disambiguation, so a
word that is not approved as a verb but approved as a noun gives a false hit.
Code blocks, code spans, URLs, and headings are removed before the count.
Numbers from this tool compare two texts run through the same version. They are
not a compliance verdict.

Usage:

  cat text.md | python3 ste_dict_lint.py -
  python3 ste_dict_lint.py --self-test
