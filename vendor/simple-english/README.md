Works in every agent that reads the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io): Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Goose, OpenCode, and about 25 more. One folder, no dependencies, MIT.

## Install

Any agent, with the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```bash
npx skills add AminBlg/SimpleEnglish
```

This installs the skill only. It does not install the session hook or the output style below, so setting `outputStyle` to `simple-english:simple-english` without the plugin does nothing. Use the Claude Code plugin for those.

Claude Code plugin, with the session hook and the output style:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add AminBlg/SimpleEnglish && claude plugin install simple-english@simple-english
```

The output style is named `simple-english:simple-english`. The short name does not resolve. Select it with `/config` under Output style, or put `{"outputStyle": "simple-english:simple-english"}` in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

Codex plugin, with the session hook:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add AminBlg/SimpleEnglish
codex plugin add simple-english@simple-english
```

Codex asks you to trust the hook before its first run. The hooks need Node.js. Details in [`src/hooks/README.md`](src/hooks/README.md).

No skill support? Paste the rule block of [`prompts/system-prompt.md`](prompts/system-prompt.md) into your system prompt, `AGENTS.md`, or `.cursorrules`. The page ends with a 60-token version for tight budgets.

Then ask for any technical writing, or say "rewrite this with simple-english".

## Benchmarks

Every number below is recomputed from the committed raw files by `python3 evals/check_numbers.py`, which CI runs on every push. All Claude runs: `claude-sonnet-4-6`, low effort, no settings loaded. Judges are Claude models on Claude text, so family bias is possible.

Replies, 8 chat questions with a jargon term each, two runs, [raw files and tables](evals/results/rebuild-2026-09-02/RESULTS.md). Counts are totals over the 16 replies. **95% fewer visible defects** (em-dashes, bold, headers, bullets) with 2.0.1 than with no skill (218 → 11). These counts come from the 2026-09-02 runs of 2.0.1, which still had the five-sentence reply cap that 2.1.0 removed. No run exists yet for 2.1.0 or later. A blind judge preferred 2.0.1 over 2.0.0 in 14 of 16 pairs.

| Condition | words | sentences | em-dashes | bold | headers | bullets |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| no skill | 216 | 16.8 | 62 | 79 | 25 | 52 |
| 2.0.0 | 184 | 14.4 | 43 | 72 | 4 | 52 |
| 2.0.1 | 146 | 7.9 | 5 | 2 | 0 | 4 |

On gpt-4.1-mini the same 8 questions went from 23 sentences, 64 bold spans, and 101 bullets per 8 replies. With 2.0.1 they went to 5.2 sentences and zero formatting.

Documents, the 8 sqlpipe writing tasks scored with the STE linter, one run per cell. One run moves by about 0.5 on this model, so read the rows as parity or better, not as a ranking.

| Condition | viol/100w | Reduction |
|---|---:|---:|
| no skill | 4.09 | |
| 1.3.0 | 2.11 | 48% |
| 2.0.0 | 1.70 | 58% |
| 2.0.1 | 0.91 | 78% |

The linter history: 81.3% fewer linter violations across 9 Claude models (144 generations, [RESULTS.md](evals/results/RESULTS.md)), plus Pi, opencode, and OpenAI runs in [`evals/results/`](evals/results/). Those numbers reproduce. A [2026-09-02 audit](evals/results/WHY-USELESS-2026-09-02.md) showed that they measure rule obedience, not what a reader sees, which is why 2.0.1 reports the reply counts above.

## The rules

Two registers in [`SKILL.md`](skills/simple-english/SKILL.md), about 1,700 tokens. The 53 numbered rules of Issue 9 live in [`rule-catalog.md`](skills/simple-english/references/rule-catalog.md) for check mode and Strict mode.

The reply, every chat answer:

| Rule | What it kills |
|---|---|
| Prose only: no headers, bullets, bold, tables | The wall of formatting around a one-line answer |
| First sentence answers | The preamble |
| No em-dashes | The spliced half-thought |
| Define a concept term in a few words | Jargon the reader has to look up |
| No contractions, openers, or closers | "Great question!" and "Hope this helps!" |

The document: docs, READMEs, runbooks, error messages, release notes:

| Rule | What it kills |
|---|---|
| Max 20 words per instruction, 25 per description | The run-on sentence |
| Condition before command | Trailing "...if the flag is set" that readers execute too late |
| Simple tenses, active voice | "has been updated", ", making it easy to..." |
| No should/would/may/might | Hedging. `can`, `will`, `must` survive |
| One word = one meaning, whole document | check/verify/confirm/validate roulette |
| Keep articles, keep "that" | Telegraph style. STE is short, not terse |
| No bold lead-ins, no heading over two sentences | Decoration that hides the fact |
| State the fact, not its importance | "crucial", "robust", "not just X, it is Y" |

Two modes. Plain, the default, is all of the above. Strict adds the STE dictionary discipline from [`strict-vocabulary.md`](skills/simple-english/references/strict-vocabulary.md) when you name STE, ASD-STE100, or compliance. The reply stays Plain in every mode.

## FAQ

Does this make output STE-certified? No. Nothing does, because ASD certifies no tool. Strict mode gets close. Word-level rulings live in the official standard, a [free download](https://www.asd-ste100.org/request.html).

Will my docs sound robotic? They will sound like Airbus manuals: flat and impossible to misread. For docs that is the whole point. Keep your voice for your blog.

Why not just prompt "write clearly"? "Clearly" is an opinion. "No sentence over 20 words" is a spec. Agents follow specs.

Why a 40-year-old aerospace standard? It is maintained (Issue 9, January 2025), numbered, and testable. It is also a near-perfect negative of every AI writing tell.

How was it built? Against the primary Issue 9 text, not summaries. A community audit ([#4](https://github.com/AminBlg/SimpleEnglish/issues/4)) checked the vocabulary tables against the dictionary. Scenarios and recorded results: [`evals/pressure-tests.md`](evals/pressure-tests.md).

## Word-choice linter

`evals/ste_lint.py` measures the mechanical rules and cannot see word choice. [`tools/ste-dictionary/`](tools/ste-dictionary/README.md) holds an extractor that builds the word lists from your own copy of the free Issue 9 PDF. A linter reads them. The repository ships the tool and no dictionary content, because the standard forbids reproduction without written authority from ASD.

## Contributing

Open an issue for questions and bug reports. Pull requests are welcome. A change that moves a published number ships the raw files with it, and `python3 evals/check_numbers.py` must pass. Run `python3 evals/ste_lint.py --self-test` before you push. Say in the PR whether an agent wrote the code, and do not add attribution trailers.
